### âœ… **Easy (1â€“7)**

Basic understanding of loops and number operations.

1. **Print numbers from 1 to 10**
   *Level: Easy*

2. **Print all even numbers between 1 to 50**
   *Level: Easy*

3. **Calculate the sum of first N natural numbers**
   *Level: Easy*

4. **Print multiplication table of a given number**
   *Level: Easy*

5. **Count the number of digits in an integer**
   *Level: Easy*

6. **Reverse a given number**
   *Level: Easy*

7. **Print each digit of a number (one per line)**
   *Level: Easy*

### ðŸŸ¡ **Medium (8â€“15)**

Adds some logical checks and slightly complex conditions.

8. **Check if a number is a palindrome (e.g., 121)**
   *Level: Medium*

9. **Check if a number is a prime**
   *Level: Medium*

10. **Find factorial of a number using while loop**
    *Level: Medium*

11. **Calculate base^exponent (e.g., 2^5)**
    *Level: Medium*

12. **Sum of digits of a number**
    *Level: Medium*

13. **Print Fibonacci series up to N terms**
    *Level: Medium*

14. **Accept numbers from user until they enter 0, then print total sum**
    *Level: Medium*

15. **Count how many times a specific digit appears in a number**
    *Level: Medium*

### ðŸ”´ **Hard (16â€“20)**

Involve nested logic, user input loops, or special number checks.

16. **Find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers**
    *Level: Hard*

17. **Check if a number is an Armstrong number (e.g., 153 = 1Â³ + 5Â³ + 3Â³)**
    *Level: Hard*

18. **Build a menu-driven calculator (repeat until user chooses Exit)**
    *Level: Hard*

19. **Check if a number is a Strong number (sum of factorial of digits = number)**
    *Level: Hard*

20. **Create a "Guess the Number" game**
    *Level: Hard*
